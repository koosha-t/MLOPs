# Deploying Machine Learning Models Using Kubeflow

## Hello Kubeflow

### Setting up KubeFlow on your local

Kubeflow is fairly self-contained but it requires kubectl for communicating with Kubernetes. The rest of the dependencies are inside containers.

* installing kubectl using snap:

```shell
	
	sudo snap install kubectl --classic

``` 

* installing kubectl using homebrew:

```shell
	
	brew install hubernetes-cli

```
